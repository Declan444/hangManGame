#hangManGame

The Hangman Game is designed to ask the player to try to solve the 5 letter word before the man is hanged. Each time the player gets a correct letter it is entered into the space provide for that particular letter and each time the letter is incorrect a part of the hanging process appears. Also when the letter is pressed the key turns red to signify that the letter has been pressed. If the user solves the word before the man is hanged they are congratulated and the man falls to the ground, saved, but if they don't solve the word, the man is hanged and his body minus his head falls to the ground and the game area turns red.
